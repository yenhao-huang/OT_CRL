# Baselines for Discrete Action RL Algorithms

This folder contains run scripts which reproduce published baselines for
various discrete RL algorithms.

For consistency, the architecture of any network used within these baselines
(e.g. the policy or critic) should be comparable in size and complexity. This
is equivalent to a small resnet, but for more details see `helpers.py`.
