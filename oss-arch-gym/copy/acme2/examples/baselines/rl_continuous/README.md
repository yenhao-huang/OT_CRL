# Baselines for Continuous-action RL Algorithms

This folder contains run scripts which reproduce published baselines for
various RL algorithms focusing on continuous action spaces.

For consistency, the architecture of any network used within these baselines
(e.g. the policy or critic) should be comparable in size and complexity to
an MLP([256] * 3).
