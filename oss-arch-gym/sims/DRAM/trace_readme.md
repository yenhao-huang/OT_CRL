Here is a `README` to guide you on obtaining power trace data and latency using the specified `main.py` files within the `ramulator` library.

# README

This document provides guidance on:
1. Obtaining power trace data.
2. Measuring latency for DDR4 with multi-threaded workloads.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have:
- Python 3 installed.
- Any required dependencies for `Ramulator` (consult the `Ramulator` documentation for setup instructions).

### Directory Structure

```
ramulator/
├── lib/
│   ├── record_cmd/
│   │   └── main.py
│   └── tune_ddr4_mmultithread/
│       └── main.py
```

## 1. Obtaining Power Trace Data

To generate power trace data, use the script located in `ramulator/lib/record_cmd/main.py`.

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the `record_cmd` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ramulator/lib/record_cmd
   ```
2. Run `main.py` with appropriate arguments. This script records memory command traces, which can then be analyzed to derive power consumption information.
   ```bash
   python main.py --config <config_file> --output <output_file>
   ```
   - **`--config`**: Path to the configuration file (specifies memory parameters and workload details).
   - **`--output`**: File to save the command trace (e.g., `power_trace.txt`).

3. After execution, analyze the generated command trace (`output_file`) to obtain power trace data.

   > **Note:** Power estimation might require additional analysis tools or scripts, depending on the Ramulator setup. You can use command frequencies and timing data to estimate power based on known energy models for DDR4.

### Example Command
```bash
python main.py --config example_config.cfg --output power_trace.txt
```

## 2. Measuring Latency for DDR4 (Multi-threaded)

To obtain latency data for DDR4 under a multi-threaded workload, use `main.py` in the `tune_ddr4_mmultithread` directory.

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the `tune_ddr4_mmultithread` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ramulator/lib/tune_ddr4_mmultithread
   ```
2. Run `main.py` with relevant arguments to initiate the latency measurement.
   ```bash
   python main.py --config <config_file> --threads <num_threads> --output <latency_output>
   ```
   - **`--config`**: Specifies the configuration file for DDR4 settings.
   - **`--threads`**: Number of threads to simulate a multi-threaded workload.
   - **`--output`**: File to save latency results.

3. The output file (`latency_output`) will contain detailed latency metrics, allowing you to analyze performance under different multi-threading conditions.

### Example Command
```bash
python main.py --config ddr4_config.cfg --threads 8 --output latency_data.txt
```

### Notes:
- Adjust `num_threads` based on your experiment requirements to observe latency changes under varying multi-threading levels.
- You may need to parse the `latency_output` file to compute average or peak latency based on your specific analysis requirements.

### Additional Tips

- Ensure your configuration files are correctly set up for DDR4 specifications in each script.
- Review the comments within each `main.py` script for any additional, script-specific options or configurations.

By following these instructions, you should be able to obtain power trace data and latency metrics for your DDR4 configurations. For more detailed information on Ramulator parameters, consult the official Ramulator documentation or related publications.
